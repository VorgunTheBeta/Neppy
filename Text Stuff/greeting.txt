Welcome {0} to Web Design and Development~
I'm your friendly server bot Neppy.

The rules of the server are:
Rule 1: Don't be a twat, so basically dont be a dickhead to people.
Rule 2: Try to be reasonable with the critisism you give (refer to rule 1).
Rule 3: Please keep conversations in languages other than English to a minimum. No this does not mean you cant talk about code, e.g. Japanese, Dutch, Spanish.
Rule 3.5: When speaking in another language, (refer to rule 1). Not everyone has the same language skills as you might.
Rule 4: No NSFW at all. This will result in an instant ban, no matter what.
Rule 5: Profanity is allowed, however (refer to rule 1). You can use it as a description, or even just WTF.
