 Vorgun did a diploma of software dev last year, and because of that, he got advanced standing for a class that taught python. The thing is that he never learnt it, so when the API came out and he saw that python was one of them, he made Neppy V1, or NepBot. I was originally supposed to be in 1 server, but because Vorgun forgot that he was signed in as me when joining a server, I joined instead.
